        Security in DCMSLive</h1>

        Security is about controlling access to resources, such as application components,
        data, and hardware.DCMSLive provides you a new feature where you can limit the user
        access to specific directories by assigining them a specific role and restricting
        them to access specific directories.
    </p>
    <p>
        This document discusses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="Security.htm#ReportAccess">Controlling which reports are visible
            to which users.</a></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="ReportAccess">
        Controlling which reports are visible to which users</h1>
    <p>
        In DCMSLive web administrator can control the secutity by copying reports in different
        directories.&nbsp; Access on these directories can be controled by web.config.&nbsp;
        Reports of a directory will be visible to a user if he has access to that folder.&nbsp;
        The scenarios explained below can help web adminisrator to provide the access to
        diferent users.</p>
    <p>
        At run time, the authorization module iterates through the allow and deny elements,
        starting at the most local configuration file, until the authorization module finds
        the first access rule that fits a particular user account. Then, the authorization
        module grants or denies access to a URL resource depending on whether the first
        access rule found is an allow or a deny rule.</p>
    <h2>
        Scenario 1</h2>
    <p>
        In DCMSLive all the reports are visible to all the users but sometime you want to
        restrict the access of some reports to a specific user or a group of&nbsp; users
        i.e <strong>Manager, Superviosr </strong>etc. Suppose web administrator would like
        to give access to all the reports in directory X to user of Manager group he can
        do that by simply by defining security setting in web.config &nbsp;file by the following
        way:</p>
    <pre>  &lt;location path="Report1"&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
      &lt;authorization&gt;
        &lt;allow roles="ECLIPSE\manager"/&gt;
        &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;
      &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
  &lt;/location&gt;       </pre>
    <p>
        If administrator decides to give access to a user and not a group of user then 
        instead of using
        <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">“allow roles”
        </span>you need to use<span 
            style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> “allow users”
        </span>for example if Administrator decides to give access on Repopt 1 to just 
        only a user “nmoham” then he would like to do it this way:<span 
            style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
       <pre>  &lt;location path="Report1"&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
      &lt;authorization&gt;
        &lt;allow users="ECLIPSE\nmohan"/&gt;
        &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;
      &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
  &lt;/location&gt;       </pre>
    
    <p>
        As we are using Windows security so domain name needs to be added with the user
        name or with the role name</p>
    <h2>
        Scenario 2</h2>
    <p>
        If you have multiple groups e.g <strong>Manager, Clerk,Worker</strong> and you would
        like to give access to Clerk and Worker&nbsp; to <strong>Directory Y</strong> and
        to Manager to <strong>Directory Z</strong> .In the <code>web.config </code>&nbsp;file
        you have to do the following:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;location path=&quot;Y"&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
      &lt;authorization&gt;
        &lt;allow roles=&quot;ECLIPSE\Clerk, Eclipse\Worker"/&gt;
        &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;
      &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
  &lt;/location&gt;       </pre>
    <pre>&lt;location path=&quot;Z"&gt;
    &lt;system.web&gt;
      &lt;authorization&gt;
        &lt;allow roles=&quot;ECLIPSE\Manager"/&gt;
        &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;
      &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;/system.web&gt;
  &lt;/location&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        In the above examples we have used windows role to provide the security, instead
        of windows roles you can directly provide login name to give the access to some
        directory.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Scenario 3</h2>
    <p>
        If you would like to give access to all user except the specific user or a group
        of users i.e. <strong>Clerk, Worker </strong>etc on the report or report category
        folder, in this case first you have to put the deny tag and then allow tag.&nbsp;
        Allow tag will contain the * ( means remaining users.). In the web.config file you
        have to do the following:</p>
    <pre>&lt;location path="Report1"&gt;
     &lt;system.web&gt;
       &lt;authorization&gt;
        &lt;deny roles="ECLIPSE\Clerk, Eclipse\Worker"/&gt;
        &lt;allow users="*"/&gt;
       &lt;/authorization&gt;
      &lt;/system.web&gt;
     &lt;/location&gt;    </pre>
    <p>
        As we are using Windows security so domain name needs to be added with the user
        name or with the role name.</p>
    <h2>
        Scenario 4</h2>
    <p>
        If you would like to give access to all users of a user group “Managers” but 
        also like to give access to a user which is not the part of Manager group you 
        can specifically provide the user access as showing in the following example:</p>
    <pre>&lt;location path=&quot;Z"&gt;
     &lt;system.web&gt;
       &lt;authorization&gt;
        &lt;allow roles="ECLIPSE\Manager"/&gt;
        &lt;allow users="ECLIPSE\nmohan"/&gt;
        &lt;deny users="*"/&gt;
       &lt;/authorization&gt;
      &lt;/system.web&gt;
     &lt;/location&gt;    </pre>
    <p>
        In the above example administrator is giving access to all users which are the 
        part of Managers group additionally he is also given access to a user “nmohan” 
        who is not the part of Managers group.</p>
    <h2>
        If a report is implemented in New System</h2>
    <p>
        If a report is tested and implemented at customer&#39;s end then there is no need to 
        keep the report of
        <span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:
Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">previous
        </span>systems.&nbsp; In this case there is also no need to keep the link of 
        report to old system in ExternalLinks.sitemap so this should be removed from the 
        ExternalLinks.sitemap file.
                </p>
    <p>
        For Example a report 10.07 is tested and implemented on the production server 
        then there is no need to keep the report which was developed in the old system 
        so go to the ExternalLinks.sitemap file and search for the 10.07 remove that 
        line from the file.&nbsp; This will always show you the link of new reporting 
        system for 10.07 report.&nbsp; Now if you apply security to this report the 
        report link will not visible to those who are denied to this report
