    <h3>
        Features
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fetches and displays the data for the report against the passed parameters</li>
        <li>In case of report with paging exports the selected page i.e. the page selected from
            the table and if run staight away for passed parameters then exports first page</li>
        <li>The format of any report isn't altered and remains the same</li>
        <li>Hiding each an every component from the page to export which is of least use for
            PDF eg. None of the button is displayed in PDF, recently viewed reports link is
            not been displayed, About box is also not displayed nor the filters etc</li>
        <li>Each page displays Title at the header and date of generating the PDF at footer</li>
        <li>All the links of the page are exported as plain text i.e. clicking those links in
            the PDF will not have any effect this rule also applies to table headers</li>
        <li>Each page displays its page number to get the index of current page of all the available
            pages</li>
        <li>Attributes for PDF have been set which can be viewed from its file -> properties,
            the attributes set by us are
            <ul>
                <li>Title: Title of report</li>
                <li>Created Date: Current date</li>
                <li>Author Name: Logged in user</li>
                <li>Subject: Report Header</li>
                <li>Keyword: Report description</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Steps to perform for PDF export</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Paste the supplied assembly *.dll to the bin folder</li>
        <li>Insert a button in the ButtonBar, click handler of this button will perform the
            action for PDF export</li>
        <li>PageBase class within App_Code folder will be responsible for communicating with
            the supplied assembly and calling its function for PDF export and performing all
            the work on PDF document, it will also be responsible for communicating with other
            class about whether to perform PDF export or not</li>
        <li>Since we would like to remove left side bar in MaterPage while pdfexport so the
            placeholder containing the side bar should be set to visible = "false" while exporting</li>
        <li>Removing side bar should remove the padding of repots grid so that it can adjust
            to free left space so the css class for same should be set to empty</li>
        <li>For removing Expand All and Collapse All buttons while exporting the GridView need
            to perform some work, these work are in classes GridViewEx.cs and GridViewExMasterRow.cs
            so the dll for EclipseLibrary also need to be renewed</li>
        <li>Any work if to be performed on ServerControl has to be performed in the click event
            of export button</li>
        <li>Change the Default style sheet present within App Themes folder since the selector
            for main-content has changed from id selector to class selector</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Limitations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Table header i.e. column header for each page does not repeat as in case of HTML</li>
        <li>Table with large data may halt export</li>
    </ol>
