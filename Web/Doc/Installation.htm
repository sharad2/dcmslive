        DcmsLive Installation</h1>
    <h3>
        Objective</h3>
    <p>
        Create a website which will serve the pages of DcmsLive web. IIS will be configured
        to pass intranet user identity to the application. After installation DcmsLive 
        will be configuired to specify the database connect strings. Optionally, you can 
        restrict access to some reports from specific users.</p>
    <h3>
        System Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Windows Server 2003 R2 running IIS6.</p>
    <h3>
        Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IIS Preinstalled:</strong>
            <p>
                Ensure that IIS 6 is installed on the server. This web server is used for serving all pages in DcmsLive.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>.NET Framework 4.0: </strong>
            <p>
                Make sure .Net Framework 4.0 should be installed on the server. You can download 
                it from one of many Microsoft links.</p>
        </li>
        <li>ODP.NET 11.2. This is required for connecting to the Oracle Server.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Deploy DcmsLive</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Extract supplied zip file:</strong>
            <p>
                You should first extract the contents of the zip file into a temporary directory
                (c:\temp). After extraction succeeds you will see a <a href="file:///C:/temp/DcmsLive">
                    C:\temp\DcmsLive</a> directory which will contain all the necessary files. You
                should then move this DcmsLive directory to a convenient location (c:\Dcms\DcmsLive
                is recommended).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Create Virtual Directory</strong>
            <p>
                <a href="CreateVirtualDirectory.htm" target="_blank">Create a Virtual directory</a>&nbsp;
                named <strong>DcmsLive</strong>. Any other name can also be specified but virtual
                directory with that name should not already exist. Specify <a href="file:///c:/Dcms/DcmsLive">
                    c:\Dcms\DcmsLive</a> as the path for this virtual directory. Disable anonymous
                access and enable windows authentication for this virtual directory.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Verify Installation</h3>
    <p>
        The installation need to be verified for the proper installation. Specify the URL
        <a href="http://%3Cservername%3E/DcmsShared">http:/localhost/DcmsLive</a> in your
        browser on machine in which you have just installed DcmsLive. You should see a list
        of available reports.</p>
