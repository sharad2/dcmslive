Report Development Patterns:

1) Single data source, single query
2) Multiple data sources and grids. We decide which one to show based on parameter entered.[Multi-View pattern]
3) Master Detail Reports.
4) Matrix reports.
5) Reports which are based on shifts.
7) Reports without parameters.
8) Reports with mutually exclusive parameters.
9) Displaying *** or similar when cell has multiple values.
10) Adding custom columns to the matrix field.
11) Displaying multiple grids
12) Hyperlink in Matrix field
13) Show\Hide columns on the basis of passsed parameter value

New Patterns (25 Aug 2009)
- Calculating cumulative totals and averages (150.06)
- Displaying summaries at the top of the report. 110.03

TODO:
Command parsring should allow using clauses when parameter equals a specific value.
Calculated column field, e.g. 40.30

SiteHyperlink Control?
Option to show or hide grand total in the master detail report

Goal:
Custom validation should not be necessary.
