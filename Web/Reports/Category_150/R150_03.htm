    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This report shows the Validation productivity of each validator for date or date
        range. Data can also be filltered on the basis shifts . Validation
        productivity is measured by monitoring average cartons per hours validated by a
        validator.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Note :--</b> </p>
    <ol><li>
        If same box is marked as INVALIDATED through Validation program consistantly again and again then in this scenario for productivity this report will consider only the first occurance of such box.
    </li>
        <li>
            If a box which is already INVALIDATED and it comes again to Validation station after some time and again gets INVALIDATED then in this scenario this box will be considered for the productivity. </li></ol>
        <p>
        The report is helpful for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>For monitoring the validator's productivity. </li>
        <li>For identifying the star performers and the black sheep. </li>
        <li>For monitoring the validator's productivity for shift bases also. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        Calculating&nbsp; the counts of green box by work station, operator, operation 
        date, case id&nbsp; and process id&nbsp; and the counts other then the green box 
        count&nbsp; by work station, operator, operation date and process id from 
        Box_productity table.</p>
    <p>
        We are calculating system hours as diffrence of&nbsp; max operation_end_date and 
        min of opertaion_start_date by each work station, operator, operation start date 
        and process id.</p>
    <h2>
        Output
    </h2>
    <p>
        The report displays one row per workstation, user and validation date.
