        This report displays the pitching and restocking hourly productivity for a given
        operation date or date range. You can also filter on the basis of first shift,second
        shift or all shifts along with the Vitual Warehouse and warehouse location. Displays
        the over all productivity within the DC(Distribution center). Also display running
        average of pitched pieces per clock hour and pieces to be pitched in one hour based
        on the scanning time.</p>
    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    For a specified,operation date/date range the report displays the hourly productivity
    for $RST and PITCH operation code where $RST shows the information with Restocked
    cartons only. Information related to cartons in suspense is not displayed. The report
    displays :<br />
    <ul>
        <li>Productivity for operation code $RST and PITCH during a particular hour which do
            not include cartons in suspense.</li>
        <li>Operation Date at which the productivity take place for a specified operation code.
        </li>
        <li>Start Time for a particular operation date or date range during a particular hour.
        </li>
        <li>End Time for a particular operation date or date range during a particular hour.
        </li>
        <li>Total pieces pitched or restocked between a particular operation hour of that operation
            date. </li>

        Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Restocking</i>
            <ul>
                <li>It provides functionality for restocking carton contents i.e. SKU to specific rail
                    location for which requirement has been already generated. Requirement must be generated
                    for a location and carton must be physically present (by pulling) at restock aisle
                    before restocking that carton content to that particular location. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Pitching</i>
            <ul>
                <li>A customer order is fulfilled on sending the required inventory to the respective
                    customer. The required inventory is packed in boxes and these boxes are then shipped
                    to the relevant customer. The process of filling the boxes with the required inventory
                    is known as Pitching. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Starting Hour</i>
            <ul>
                <li>The rounded value of hours of OPERATION_START_DATE for each OPERATION_CODE, WAREHOUSE_ID
                    and OPERATION_START_DATE.<br />
                    For eample:last activity was done at 7:01:36 i.e. Starting hours is 7:00:00</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Ending Hour</i>
            <ul>
                <li>The rounded value of hours of OPERATION_END_DATE for each OPERATION_CODE, WAREHOUSE_ID
                    and OPERATION_START_DATE.<br />
                    For eample:last activity was done at 7:28:36 i.e. Ending hours is 8:00:00<br />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Lunch</i> <i>Hour</i><ul>
            <li>The value of lunch hours which is deducted from total hours worked for lunch time.
                <br />
                i.e. 0.5 hours lunch each shift. We will not deduct any lunch hours in between 5
                to 12, we will deduct .5 as lunch hours in between 12 to 21 and after 21 we will
                deduct 1 as lunch hours for day operation. There is hradcoding for lunch time in
                first shift it is 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM and in secon shift it is 9:00 PM to 9:30
                PM.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Hours Worked</i>
            <ul>
                <li>The total hours worked for the day. It is cumulative hour by hour so at last
                    we will have the total hours. The lunch break time is also deducted from respective
                    hour. It is calculate as follows:<br />
                    Ending Hour - Lunch Hour -&nbsp; Shift Start Hour</li>
                <li>If this report is running for all shift then it take first shift start hour as shift
                    start hour otherwise it take shift start time as shift start hour according to shift
                    choosen by the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Running average pieces per clock hour</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Total pieces pitched&nbsp;per hour worked per warehouse. The hours worked will
                    be calculated from shift start time. It is calculated as follows:<br />
                    total pieces pitched / total clock hours pitched<br />
                    Total clock hours pitched is the time in hours from the shift start time to current
                    hour in which he pitched those pieces.</li>
                <li>For example, my shift start time is 7:00 AM and total pieces pitched for 10th hour(pieces
                    pitched during 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM) are 210 then Running Average pieces per clock
                    hour will be 210/(10 -7) = 70. If lunch hours are also coming then 30 min also deducted.<br />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Running average pieces per system pitch hour</i>
            <ul>
                <li>Total pieces pitched per system pitch hour per warehouse, calculate the pieces assuming
                    if only user need to scan to complete the pitching. This is based on actual scan
                    time not on process start and end time diffrence. This shows, according to system
                    how many pieces to be pitched if only scanning will be done. It is calculate as
                    follows:<br />
                    total pieces pitched / total scan time.<br />
                    Total scan time is that time, that is took by pitcher in scanning the pieces.</li>
                <li>For example, a pitcher pitch 200 pieces for 10th hour(pieces pitched during 9:00
                    AM to 10:00 AM), and total scan time for scanning these 200 pieces is 20 seconds,
                    then Running average pieces per system pitch hour will be 200/(20/3600) = 4000.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>Actual Working start time and Ending time</i><ul>
            <li>The first shift start time is 5.00 AM but
                normal working start time for first shift is 7.00 AM. Due to this reason we added 
                2 hours from the first shift start time. On the basis of normal working shift 
                start we are calculating the running average pieces per clock hour. Also we are not shows any value in running average pieces per clock hour and Running 
                average pieces per system pitch hours if user will start
                his work before the start of normal working hours for first shift. </li>
            <li>There is no difference in second shift start time and normal working hours for second
                shift start time. Due to this reason we will not deduct any hours from second shift
                start time. But the normal ending working hours for second shift is 2.30 AM. Due
                this reason we will not shows any value in running average pieces per clock hour 
                and Running average pieces per system pitch hours
                if user will finish his work after the ending of normal working hours for second
                shift. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

   <pre>
    Note System Hours are fetched from query and not show in grid value of system hours for first row is 1940 and second is 945 respectively<br />
    In case there are no system_seconds we would not calculate values of Running Av Pieces per Clock hr and Running Av Pieces Per Pitch hr<br />
    parameters passed to get this out put are as follows:-
    Operation date From:-4/16/2010  to:-4/16/2010<br />
    Shift=All<br />
    Virtual Warehouse=All<br />
    Warehouse Location=All<br />
    <b>calculation for first row is done as follows:-</b>
    * First We get  End time which is 15:49 PM and  Start time 15:07 PM<br />
    * From  end time we get  working day start time,which is 5.00 AM as this example is for all shift<br />
    * End hour is round of value of End time and that calculates as 15:00 PM<br />
    * we add one hour in  End hour as work was performed between 15:00 PM and 16:00 PM. So End hour becomes 16:00 PM <br />
    * Now we calculate   clock hours ,which is  calculated as  clock hours=  End hour-  Working day start<br />
    * so it becomes   = 16.00 PM- 5.00 AM i.e 11:00 hours<br />
    * Now we will need total hours worked which is clock hours- lunch hours<br />
    * i.e. 0.5 hours lunch each shift. We will not deduct any lunch hours in between 5
     to 12, we will deduct .5 as lunch hours in between 12 to 21 and after 21 we will
    deduct 1 as lunch hours for day operation. There is hradcoding for lunch time in
    first shift it is 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM and in secon shift it is 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM.<br />
    * In our case we will deduct 30 minutes from clock hours as our duration of working hours is between 12 and 21.our working hours are between 15:00 PM and 16:00 PM<br />         
    * so now total hours worked=11.00-.30 i.e 10.30<br />      
    * if report is running for no shift or for the first shift we deduct 2 hours from total hours worked<br />
    * since our example is also for all shifts hence total hours worked=(total hours worked-2) and it  become 8.30<br />
    * Running Av Pieces per Clock hr = totalpices/total hours worked.hours
                                        = 31/ 8.5
                                        = 3.65<br />
   Running Av Pieces Per Pitch hr=total pieces/pitched hours<br />
   pitched hours=system seconds/3600<br />
   system seconds are fetched from mpc_productivity.seconds_worked<br />
   in our example systems seconds are 1940<br />
   so pitched hours=1940/3600
                   =0.5388
   pitched hours= 31/0.5388
                = 57.5257
   while Calculating for second row pieces and pitched hours are comulated as date remain same.
   hence pices become=31+6=37 and pitched hours=0.533 + 945/3600.
   Rest of the calculation are done as above

    <h2>
        Details</h2>
    <b>Pitching Process</b> A pitcher performs the activity of pitching by picking up
    a cart from a pre defined area, fill all the boxes present on this cart and finally
    leaves the cart at the drop off area. From this area, a transporter moves all these
    boxes to either the red area or green area. A cart normally contains NINE boxes
    at a time.Before the pitching starts, a box may not be empty since earlier less
    pieces were available due to which the box remained incomplete and now remaining
    pieces are required to be pitched.
    <h2>
        Algorithm</h2>
    Get the sum of pieces and units for a particular operation date or date range from
    BOX_PRODUCTIVITY. and where outcome is equal to restocked for operation_code $RST
    and PITCH. Get the system hours for a particular opertaion date or date range from
    MPC_PRODCUTIVITY.

        <li>
            Currently we are getting the shift start time for calculating the running average 
            pieces per clock hour. Now we will calculate this column value on the basis of 
            normal working start time. By NM 23 Dec 2009 email “150.06 run rate report 
            enhancements (ticket 91930)“ 5th November 2009.For better performance now this productivity report will show productivity only
