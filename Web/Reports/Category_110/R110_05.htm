    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    For the specified audit date/date range the report displays
    <ol>
        <li>The detail for each pitcher. </li>
        <li>It will further drilldown on pitcher to show the carton-wise detail.</li>
    </ol>
    Note: The report shows you all of the boxes that where pitched but if a box is scan
    more then one time we only consider the last scan of the box.
    <h2>
        Algorithm</h2>
    Get the box qc audit details from box_productivity from passed
    operation dates.
