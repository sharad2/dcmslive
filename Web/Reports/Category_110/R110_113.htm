        This report displays the number of boxes in different areas for different PO&#39;s 
        for passed customer and virtual warehouse. It shows the un-started pieces, expected pieces, packed 
        pieces, and cancelled pieces of all un-transferred and un-cancelled customer orders for passed customer and 
        virtual warehouse. It also shows progress of order (% packed pieces verses 
        ordered pieces) for passed customer and virtual warehouse. The user has 
        option&nbsp;to filter out the data on the basis of specified PO , Pickslip, Label and 
        Bucket. </p>
    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For the specified Customer this report is showing the number of boxes in each area
            for different PO&#39;s. Also showing the progress of each PO.</li>
        <li>It can be drilldown on PO to show the number of boxes in each area for different
            customer DC of that particular PO and customer.</li>
        <li>This page is showing number of boxes in different areas. It can further drilldown
            to show the box detail for customer in that area.</li>
        <li>For the sake of performance we are considering those pickslips whose import date
            is less than two months from today by default but user can change the days as he
            want.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Algorithm
    </h2>
    <p>
        For finding the no. of boxes in each area per PO for passed customer_id and virtual
        warehouse using the table PS, BOX, BOXDET, IA, IACONFIG and BUCKET where the available
        for pitching flag is not null of bucket&nbsp; and&nbsp; pickslip reporting status is not null of those customer.</p>
    <p>
        For calculating the un-strated pieces we are using the view rep_active_ps and bucket
        table that have the pickslips of status 1 and pickslips whose bucket is made but
        available for pitching flag is null.</p>
    <h2>
        Definition</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b><i>Expediter Bucket. </i></b>Those boxes which have not been assigned to an MPC
            yet.</li>
        <li><b><i>Packed Pieces: </i></b>Total no. of Current Pieces in boxes which are lying
            in shipping area means ready to ship. We get the shipping area on the basis of shipping_area_flag
            which is set as Y in IA table.</li>
        <li><b><i>Unstarted Pieces :</i></b>Total quantity ordered for those pickslips for whom
            buckets are not created or if created then still not available for pitching.</li>
        <li><b><i>Expected Pieces: </i></b>Total no. of ordered Pieces in boxes which
            are in process and which are not shipped yet.</li>
        <li><b><i>Cancelled Pieces:</i></b>Total no. of current pieces of boxes which are cancelled.</li>
        <li><b><i>%Completed:</i></b>% complete is calulated as follows:<br />
            Packed pieces * 100 / ((Unstarted Pieces + Started&nbsp; Pieces) - Cancelled Pieces)</li>
