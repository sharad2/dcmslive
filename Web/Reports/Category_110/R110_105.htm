        This report displays boxes of unshipped pickslips lying in specified area along
        with their SKU detail. Several optional filters are available to help you focus
        on your orders of interest: PO, Pickslip, Customer, bucket, MPC, Label ,DC , DC
        Cancel date, BOL, Customer Store and ATS date. Only in process pickslips will be
        considered in this report. You also have the option to focus on validated pickslips
        only.
        Now you get to know list of&nbsp; boxes specific VAS in different areas with the helps of VAS filter.</p>
    <p>
        Please Note: Box Id is repeated in PO Consolidation case when one box belongs to
        more than one PO.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    The goal of this report is to make visible the progress of all unshipped pickslips.
    As a pickslip is processed within the DC, boxes get created and these boxes move
    from one area to another and eventually reach the shipping area. This report shows
    the number of boxes along with detail of each box in the specified box area. The
    box detail includes the SKUs in box and respective expected pieces and current pieces
    in each box.
    <p>
        If you want to focus on a smaller subset of unshipped pickslips, you can do this
        by using optionally specifying one or more following filters:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Area:</b> Select a specific area to view the information. There are 3 conceptual
            areas also showing the box&#39;s condition in the DC.These 3 conceptual areas are
            described below</li>
        <li><i><b>Expediter Bucket:</b></i>Those boxes which have not been assigned to an MPC
            yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
        <li><i><b>Unstarted Cancelled:</b></i> Those boxes which were cancelled before they
            were assigned to an MPC.</li>
        <li><i><b>MPC Unstarted:</b></i> Unpitched boxes which belong to some MPC. By contrast,
            area PIT contains boxes for which pitching has started. After pitching is complete
            for a box, it moves to RED or GRN area.</li>
        <li><b>PO</b>. The purchase order which you wish to track.</li>
        <li><b>Pickslip</b>. A specific pickslip id if you are interested in the progress of
            a single pickslip.</li>
        <li><b>Customer</b>. This allows you to track order progress of a specific customer.</li>
        <li><b>MPC.</b> This allows you to track the progress of a specific MPC.</li>
        <li><strong>Bill Of Lading. </strong>This parameter is for filtering the report on the
            basis of passed BOL</li>
        <li><strong>Store</strong>. This parameter can be passed if user wants to see the report
            for a particular Store. </li>
        <li><b>Label</b>. To track progress of a boxes containing SKUs of a specific label.</li>
        <li><b>DC</b>. To track boxes destined for a specific DC. If you specify this parameter,
            it is highly recommended that you specify customer id as well. This is because different
            customers can have same DC Id.</li>
        <li><b>Validated Only</b>. Choosing this option includes only those boxes which have
            successfully passed through the validation station.</li>
        <li><b>Customer Type</b>. You can use this parameter the see the box detail of Domestic
            or international customers. By default, the box detail for all customer will be
            displayed.</li>
        <li><strong>ATS Date</strong>. For EDI customers, user can use this parameter to know
            the details of the boxes in the orders that are assigned with the passed ATS(Avaliable
            To Ship) date.</li>
        <li><strong>DC Cancel Date. </strong>On the basis of this parameter user can filter
            the data based on dc cancel date.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that some combination of parameters do not make any sense. For example, if
        a pickslip is specified, specifying a PO adds no value since only a single pickslip
        will be displayed anyway. In fact, if the specified PO does not contain the specified
        pickslip, no rows will be displayed. It is up to you to specify a sensible combination
        of parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purpose of this report, unshipped pickslip is defined as that pickslip for
        which information has not been sent to Richter yet. This means that even if you
        ship the pickslip, it will be visible to this report until data for this pickslip
        is transferred to Richter.
