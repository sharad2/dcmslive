        This report displays the number of boxes in different areas for each customer and
        virtual warehouse. It shows the un-started pieces, expected pieces, packed pieces,
        and cancelled pieces of all un-transferred and un-cancelled customer orders for each customer and virtual warehouse.
        It also shows progress of order (% packed pieces verses ordered pieces) for each
        customer and virtual warehouse. </p>
    <h2>
        Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This report shows the number of boxes in each area, the total no. of un-started 
            pieces, expected pieces, packed pieces, cancelled pieces and % of packed pieces for
            each customer and virtual warehouse. The user has option&nbsp; to filter out the
            data on the basis of specified Customer, PO , Pickslip, Label, Bucket and the Virtual
            Warehouse. This report only displays the records for un-transferred and 
            un-cancelled pickslips.</li>
        <li>It can further drilldown on customer to show the number of boxes in each area for
            different PO&#39;s of that customer. </li>
        <li>This page is showing number of boxes in different areas. It can further drilldown
            to show the box detail for that customer in that area</li>
        <li>For the sake of performance we are considering those pickslips whose import date
            is less than two months from today by default but user can change the days as he
            want.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        For finding the no. of boxes in each area per customer and virtual warehouse using
        the table PS, BOX, BOXDET, IA and BUCKET where the available of pitching flag is
        not null of bucket and pickslip reporting status is not null of passed or all customers.</p>
    <p>
        For calculating the un-started pieces we are using the view rep_active_ps and bucket
        table that have the pickslips of status 1 and pickslips whose bucket is made but
        available for pitching flag is null.</p>
    <h2>
        Definition</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b><i>Expediter Bucket. </i></b>Those boxes which have not been assigned to an MPC
            yet.</li>
        <li><b><i>Packed Pieces: </i></b>Total no. of Current Pieces in boxes which are lying
            in shipping area means ready to ship. We get the shipping area on the basis of shipping_area_flag
            which is set as Y in IA table.</li>
        <li><b><i>Unstarted Pieces :</i></b>Total quantity ordered for those pickslips for whom
            buckets are not created or if created then still not available for pitching.</li>
        <li><b><i>Expected Pieces: </i></b>Total no. ordered Pieces in boxes which
            are in process and which are not shipped yet.</li>
        <li><b><i>Cancelled Pieces:</i></b>Total no. current pieces of boxes which are cancelled.</li>
        <li><b><i>%Completed:</i></b>% complete is calulate as follows:<br />
            Packed pieces * 100 / ((Unstarted Pieces + Expected&nbsp; Pieces) - Cancelled Pieces)</li>
    </ul>
