        Calculation of number of Aisle:</h3>
    <p>
        While locating or pullig cartons if one aisle is visited consecutively then it will
        be counted 1 aisle. But if user visited an aisle which he was already viisited but
        not the same as previous aisle then it will be counted as a new aisle. for Example
        : There is a pallet with 10 cartons on it which needs to be located.
