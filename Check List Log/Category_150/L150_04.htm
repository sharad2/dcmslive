        Meeting Notes 15 Jul 2009:</p>
    <p>
        1. Remove orivate synonym warehouseloc from dcmslive so that new reports cannot 
        use it.</p>
    <p>
        2. Remove all queries from document.</p>
    <p>
        3. Do not fail due to approval. Get it after passing.</p>
    <p>
        4. Report columns should be documented. The sequence of columns should be right 
        as far as possible but it is not a cause for failure.</p>
    <p>
        5. Remove Behavior change section from document. If necewssary, take the 
        information to some main section.</p>
